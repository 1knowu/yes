Compile & Run
Compile the Code
The easiest method is to use the build task. With your `.c` file open, press `Ctrl+Shift+B`. Alternatively, you can compile manually from the terminal. For a file named `my_program.c`, the command is:

gcc -fopenmp my_program.c -o my_program

Run the Executable
After a successful compilation, an executable file is created. Run it from the terminal:

# On Windows
./my_program.exe
